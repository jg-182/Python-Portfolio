# Net salary calculator - Portugal 2024

This is a small project, developed by me, to practise and understand some Python concepts. 
In this project, I made a simple calculator to calculate the **net salary of a worker in Portugal**. The [2024 tax tables](https://info.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/pt/apoio_contribuinte/tabela_ret_doclib/Pages/default.aspx) were taken into account. 
It's a simplified calculator because some points were not taken into account:

 - The meal allowance is always considered to be tax-free; 
 - The net salary is considered to be the result of the gross salary + meal allowance, i.e. there is no other income or twelfths;  
 - This calculator does not apply to the Madeira and Azores regions.
